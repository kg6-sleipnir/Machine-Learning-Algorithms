# Machine Learning Algorithms
Algorithms for machine learning using Python

## Purpose/Motivation
To serve as an educational way to teach myself ML and better programming
practices. Additionally, as a way to compare different implementations of
similar ML models using different frameworks.

## Current Models

### Neural Network Using Logistic Regression (neural_net.py)
This algorithm is a neural network that uses the Sigmoid function as its
activation function, which is a commonly used non-linear function. The network
can be initialized to use any number of inputs, hidden layers, hidden layer
sizes, and outputs. In the current model, the network has two inputs, one hidden
layer with four neurons, and provides one output, with the goal of learning the
output of a binary operator for any given pair of inputs.
